This is a basic HTTP server implementation in Python that serves static files and handles HTTP requests. The server listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 and serves an index.html file as the main page. It can handle various file types by detecting MIME types automatically and serves files from a files directory. The server supports both text and binary files, uses multithreading to handle concurrent connections, and includes proper error handling for 404 (file not found), 415 (unsupported media type), and 500 (internal server error) responses. Simply run python main.py to start the server and access it at http://localhost:8080.
